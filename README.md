# myfflbot

myfflbot is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was
initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be
deployed on [Heroku][heroku] to get you up and running as quick as possible.

This README is intended to help get you started. Definitely update and improve
to talk about your own instance, how to use and deploy, what functionality he
has, etc!

### Running myfflbot Locally

You can test your hubot by running the following, however some plugins will not
behave as expected unless the [environment variables](#configuration) they rely
upon have been set.

You can start myfflbot locally by running:

    % bin/hubot

You'll see some start up output and a prompt:

    [Sat Feb 28 2015 12:38:27 GMT+0000 (GMT)] INFO Using default redis on localhost:6379
    myfflbot>

Then you can interact with myfflbot by typing `myfflbot help`.

    myfflbot> myfflbot help
    myfflbot livescoring
    myfflbot help - Displays all of the help commands that myfflbot knows about.
